In job interviews, I often get asked about my experience in each place that I have been. I am uncomfortable answering since it always feels like I’m missing something, and that too much emphasis is set to be put on the wrong things.

I have written this short summary to talk about my experiences in a, hopefully, more balanced way.

## Teleservice

My career started in 2014, when I got an internship at Teleservice Skåne AB, a family-owned company in the middle of rural Skåne, dealing in IT services, broadband & fiber. I got the task to develop client software for their rescue automation platform, Blue Light Information Service (BLIS). The technology used was C#/.NET and WPF. I had a fun collaborative process together with the product owner. 

After the internship ended, I became an employee, and I joined the rest of the development team in developing custom-made software systems spanning all of their business areas. The technologies used were mainly Web, PHP, and NodeJS. I met a lot of great people at the company. Some of us hung out regularly outside work. My time at Teleservice really defined me as a person.

I left due to changes in the workplace.

The BLIS platform is now owned by AddSecure. Knowing that the software that I have built continues to aid in saving lives makes me proud.

## Starting as consultant

In 2016, I became a consultant for Tedsys, part of the Tedkomp group, a medium-sized IT consultancy company in Malmö. There I was hired by a nice guy who became my manager. I was glad that I had met someone who saw what I had to give.

I did a short assignment for BRA Flyg, an airline company, over the summer.

## CellaVision

My first real assignment was at CellaVision in Lund. They developed medical equipment that aided in the analysis of blood cells using machine learning. I worked on their Windows client software, and their educational web app that taught users how to classify blood cells. Technologies used were C#, WPF, C++, and Silverlight. I absolutely liked the people that I worked together with at CellaVision.

I also got to learn about the impact of the regulatory requirements in the medical business when it comes to software verification. 

## Skanska

In 2017, I did a short assignment for Skanska in Malmö. They were upgrading their intranet site and needed someone to integrate search functionality in the new frontend. The technologies used were Web, ASP.NET and C#. The site was based on EpiServer.

## Axis Communications and ESSIQ

### New Business

After leaving Skanska, I joined as a consultant at Axis Communications in Lund. As part of their web development team in the New Business division, I got to build the web-based on-device experience from which you can configure devices, like an Axis camera or door station. We mainly used React as the web framework, but some older projects used Backbone and Ractive. The project methodology was Scrum with occasional Kanban. 

My experience in the team was overall great. I learned a lot. My time in the team did contribute a lot to my personal growth. I connected with people that I still keep in touch with to this day. To add to this: I did some projects in my free time that got recognition from the managers.

In early 2018, I switched consultancy company to ESSIQ, when my previous manager who had hired me for Tedsys had convinced me to come over. I was not content with my previous company because I did not feel that I got recognition from them. I felt estranged from it.

### Small & Medium Business

When I went to another consultancy company I had to get a new assignment. Fortunately, there was a need for a .NET consultant in a another division at Axis. 

So then I joined the Small & Medium Business division. There I was part of quite a big team developing a Video Management Software (VMS) for Windows in C# and WPF. This was when they were about to go to the Cloud. The codebase was quite impressive. It gave me insight in a lot of software design patterns. 

I found it hard to adjust to my new environment, because of this team having a different culture. And I missed my old team. I left this assignment after just 8 months.

## Tetra Pak

In January 2019, I started as a consultant at Tetra Pak on Lund, working on their current Manufacturing Execution System (MES), which was a production plant automation platform with a monolithic codebase having a legacy spanning 15 years. I was a full stack developer working in both C#, ASP.NET, and React for frontend. I also developed a number of tools in WPF. 

One of my bigger feats was to refactor code and switch out the project system. We were two teams working on the MES, one in Sweden, the other in China, in a Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe). 

Although I got accustomed to the people that I worked with, I felt it hard to fit into the structure. I did not enjoy the corporate environment because of how rigid it was. I found the scope of the projects too big, and that there were too many people involved.

## Nordengren AI

I then did a brief assignment for Nordengren AI. My task was to build an e-commerce site for one of their customers, an insurance company. I could choose any technology as long as it was from Microsoft - so I chose Blazor for the web app. It turned out to be the start of an entire enterprise platform. The owner saw a lot of potential in me, so he lured me into signing for his company with the promise that I would get a lot of creative freedom.

The main reason for me leaving ESSIQ was dissatisfaction. I did not feel that they could give me interesting assignments. There really was no opportunity for me to grow. I did not like being so far away from the company, my tribe. With this there was always a feeling of not being enough. At time, I was disillusioned by the consultancy business, at least in this form. I saw this action of leaving as taking charge of my own life.

So at the start of the COVID pandemic, I joined Nordengren AI. I was the only software developer building the “frontend” experience both for sales and management - in reality I was a full stack .NET developer. During the course of 1,5 years the system had grown immensely, with the ability to handle the entire business process; from ordering, billing, to payment. The system was built with ASP.NET Core.

Despite being hired as a Senior Software Developer, I had a very fluent role. I was doing what I was told to do, since I was the only developer. For instance, I had to work on the customer sales sites, acting as both programmer and UX designer. I also had to migrate customer data into the system. What I produced in such a short time was truly impressive.

I liked having the overview over the technical aspects as well as the opportunity to make some creative decisions. When working in this project, I learned a lot about both the technological aspects as well as the business domain, and how to design a system. Many lessons learned from just doing it.

The project management was less than ideal. It was said to be “agile”, but it was a stretch of the truth. I just did what I was told to do because the boss needed to satisfy urgent customer needs. The plan did often not hold up. This software project was too big for just one person to work on.

Eventually, I left Nordengren AI because of the stressful situation.
