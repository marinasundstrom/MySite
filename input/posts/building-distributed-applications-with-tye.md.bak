## What is a Distributed Application?

It is an application that is being distributed across multiple *services* that may run i separate processes, and on different machines. A service can be a custom-built web application, a database server, a Redis server, or any other application.

This is a common way of structuring applications in cloud scenarios. For instance, you might have an application that consists of an order service and a billing service. These service share a dependency on each others functionality. Usually, this communication goes through some type of API or asynchronous messaging system, like a message broker that runs out-of-process.

Microservices are a common type of distributed application. The detail here is that for a service to be considered a "*micro* service" it usually would be confined to a specific domain, or bounded context, in which it owns and manages its own data.

In short, when you are building an application consisting on multiple separate but dependant services, then you are building a *Distributed Application*.

## The relationship with Docker

Docker is a virtualization software that enables containerization of software.
